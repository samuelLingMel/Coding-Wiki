# Coding-Wiki

There is no better way to learn anything than to teach it to someone else, That is the philosophy behind my coiding wiki.

This is a place where beginners can try to put what they have learnt into words to help other beginners. Anyone can peruse the articles hosted, but you need to create and account and login if you want to create one.

My coding wiki is a Ruby app, ruby RESTful api as a server, with multiple databases and is deployed on Heroku.

It was endlessly hard to find the right words to express the new concepts and ideas I was learning but it was deeply helpful thinking about it in a way to communicate rather than just how to apply it.
